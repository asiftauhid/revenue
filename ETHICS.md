   - Adhere to the website's terms of service and privacy policy.

2. Identify Your Scraper
   - Use a clear and honest User-Agent string that identifies your scraper.
   - Provide contact information for website owners to reach out if needed.

3. Minimize Server Impact
   - Implement rate limiting to avoid overloading servers.
   - Schedule scraping during off-peak hours when possible.

4. Data Usage and Privacy
   - Only collect publicly available data.
   - Avoid scraping personal or sensitive information.
   - Use collected data responsibly and in accordance with data protection laws.

5. Respect Copyright
   - Do not scrape copyrighted content without permission.
   - Properly attribute any used data to its original source.

6. Transparency
   - Be open about your scraping activities and intentions.
   - Provide clear documentation on how the scraped data is used.

7. Responsible Data Handling
   - Store and process scraped data securely.
   - Delete or anonymize data when it's no longer needed.

8. Continuous Ethical Review
